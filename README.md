# Image-Hosting-Deployment
Simple image hosting web server deployed on the cloud

# Goals
This project is a WIP to learn more about the process of deploying a web app on cloud infrastructure.

Todo:
* Integrate web server with a database (likely CockroachDB to learn about distributed databases) deployed in a separate container.
* Coordinate container deployment with Kubernetes


# Updates:

Deployed using Docker on an AWS EC2 instance! This was a fun experiment learning about security groups and the process of starting up a web server on a bare-bones machine.
